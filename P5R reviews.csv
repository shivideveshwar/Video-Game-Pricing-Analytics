10,"Posted:","21-Oct-22","When Final Fantasy XV launched back in 2016 it started with a message - ""A Final Fantasy for Fans and First-TimersÓ. And while it can be argued if that is true in regards to the FF franchise, I feel that saying works really well for Persona 5. If you never played a Persona title, you can jump straight away without any fear, and what youÕll find is a game that is incredibly addictive and it definitely deserves the title Òone of the best JRPGS of all timeÓ. On a personal level, Persona 5 is one of my favorite games of all time, IÕve played through it numerous times and I still canÕt believe that IÕm doing it right now on PC. Something that was a pipe dream years ago turned into reality and I never wouldÕve missed the opportunity to support AtlusÕs decision to finally put the game on Steam. I still canÕt quite comprehend how much the series has grown since that fateful day in late 2007 when I was introduced to Persona 3 by a close friend. It was like nothing that IÕve played before and I loved it so much, that I went back and played Persona 1, 2 and numerous SMT titles, and then eagerly anticipated the release of Persona 4. When I played Persona 4 Golden for the first time back in the day, I thought that was the pinnacle of what the Persona franchise can achieve, but Atlus has shown us they have more than enough gas in the tank to keep this train going with Persona 5. The game feels much like a second home, while the outside world remains turbulent as ever, Joker and company are there for you if you need some entertainment to wind down. The characters feel like real people with real problems that are willing to test your empathy all through this 100-hour adventure. Persona 5 doesnÕt just focus on the glam, it does the mundane really well. There are moments where youÕre cleaning up your room, going out with a friend, or having your depressed guardian take you to school. You get used to just chilling and taking it all in, because every moment in this adventure counts and you foolishly start to understand it only when the end credits are starting to roll. The story is another strong point and while some moments seem predictable, it doesnÕt take away from its glory. Dungeons are improved compared to Persona 4 and they are separated in two categories campaign related and side content (which remain procedurally generated). The gameplay/combat animations are incredible and even something incredibly mundane as getting the upper hand in a battle seems smooth and stylish (even more in 120fps!). The soundtrack is brilliant and yes, during the years this has become a tradition in almost every Persona/SMT game and thank God it is, because it helps tremendously to set the mood. Persona 5 Royal is a collection of many things: inspiring stories, good times with good friends, a stunning visual novel and an amazing dungeon crawler. By working on what was already great and with brilliant new additions, Persona 5 Royal is an unforgettable experience that has you thinking about it long after itÕs over.","2022-10-21"

13,"Posted:","24-Dec-22","How am I supposed to play other games after this? The game doesn't miss a single step. It's straight 10 outta 10 in every category. 11 in some, actually. The game is so good it puts a severe strain on my vocabulary. The OST is incredible, the story is amazing, the atmosphere is unique, the UI is iconic, the gameplay is captivating, the art style is gorgeous, the role-playing is unparalleled, the voice work is pristine... The adjectives just keep on piling up. After 143 hours and all achievements one would expect me to be quite done, but here I am debating doing a NG+ run (harem time), watching the anime adaptation or just jumping into P5 Strikers immediately. The whole experience is just so unbelievable cozy, charming and enthralling that you just wanna keep on being a phantom thief ad infinitum. The only game that grabbed me so thoroughly was Persona 4 Golden. And although I still love 4 more, this one is indisputable the better game. Every single aspect is improved and the amount of quality of life features is astounding. The attention to detail is unmatched. There are a lot of good games out there. There are also quite a few excellent ones. But P5R is the kind of game that raises the bar for the whole medium. These you don't see so often. P.S. Yukiko still best waifu.","2022-12-24"

20,"Posted:","9-Nov-22","Persona 5 Royal PC port is a dream come true for Persona fans and a worthy successor to Persona 4 Golden in every way __ Massive storyline that will keep you hooked for well-over 120+ hours. Make sure you go for the true ending which is really good (hint: try to max your bonds, although not everyone's required) __ Excellent PC port, with option to play at 120 FPS which feels so smooth __ Unparalleled UI design __ Fantasic combat & gameplay with amazing soundtracks, they're so good __ Bonding rank up is extremely rewarding __ Strong dating sim elements __ QOL design is superb __ Demons can be customized pretty much the way you want __ Theives Den is pretty cool and chasing after awards can easily extend the game __ Akechi __ Persona 5 Royal gives you OP demons right at the very beginning which makes the game difficulty trivial if you use it. Also it makes you lose the 'sense of challenge' when you know you can easily take the OP demon and finish the fight. At least getting it at the end of the game or a toggle option for people who beat the game would've made more sense __ Although not necessarily a con, I believe the Theives Den awards should've been included into Steam achievements, those feel like real achievements If you played Persona 4 Golden, then maxing bonds shouldn't be very difficult. Fortune teller's bond should be maxed out first to have an easier time with others. Always select 'positive' answers and make sure you've a 'matching arcana' Persona with you when doing bonding events","2022-11-09"

29,"Posted:","21-Oct-22","HOO BOY, here we go! I've bought P5/P5R on three different occasions at full price as well as every single spin-off game. That should already tell you how good the game is and how financially irresponsible I am when it comes to Persona. Most reviews give this game a solid 10 out of 10, calling it a great masterpiece. I would go a step further and refer to this game as genre-defining. The level of precise detail and care put into Persona 5 Royal, which is debatably the best JRPG ever developed, makes it nothing less than a labor of love built upon a 25-year foundation of a masterclass in storytelling. ATLUS successfully blends the subtleties of everyday life such as time management with the reality of its plot sequences to create a great representation of both everyday life and being a Phantom Thief. You will grow to adore P5R's primary heroes, The Phantom Thieves of Hearts. You assume control of their leader, an outcast kid who has the desire to change the world. You build and strengthen bonds with confidants closest to you when you're not sneaking into castles to steal the hearts of individuals corrupted by evil. The game also features one of the most intriguing villains in the series while yet maintaining a fantasy feel with the help of bosses that are presented according to the series' canon. The side-quests aren't your repetitive copy and paste filler. There aren't really any ""Take item-deliver it there,"" ""Defeat 10 of these enemies,"" etc. side-quests, if you can even call them that. The daily activities of a high school student include side missions with actual substance, which are vital to the progression of the main plot and the development of the games cast of characters. They are activities that are optional but actually adds a whole lot to the overarching story and are absolutely worth going out of your way to do. You can't talk about Persona without talking about it's banger soundtrack! Every song is amazingly written, catchy, and the tracks in the Palaces never gets stale so listening to the music never really feels repetitive. The battle music is also top tier, and it always plays at the right moments to help set the tone and atmosphere. The tracks builds up to that point to create a feeling of hype and anticipation that is unmatched in most video games today. It's challenging for any modern game to compare to ATLUS's goal of taking their franchise to new heights because this game hits the series right in the heart. In my opinion, a modern JRPG would be a huge triumph if it even manages to surpass 50% of what Persona 5 Royal has accomplished. I genuinely believe that Persona 5 Royal is ahead of its time and will be one that is talked about in years to come. 100/10 Would recommend this game to anyone who just loves video games. P.S. They are all best girls. Harem route baby!","2022-10-21"

41,"Posted:","3-Nov-22","I might as well say this is not my first time playing through the game as I have logged over 200 hours on PS4 as well. The fact that i still bought this game again to play it again probably speaks for what i think of it, but oh well. This is a game that you should play simply because of the love, passion and sheer amount of time that went into giving the facets of the game life and style that have and will continue to inspire how games are made into the future. That's it. That's my thoughts. The rest of this review is just qualifying statements that might matter to you. Even if you dislike anime and JRPGs with turn based combat, it's entirely worth giving this game a try. However, I must warn you that if you are someone that likes to see literally everything and complete every last possible thing a game has to offer to a compulsive degree, this game is simply not for you. I'd see the video ""the completionist"" did for the original persona 5 for an explanation why. As the loading icon says, ""take your time"" and enjoy what you can get out of the game. Those two statements may seem contradictory, but I think it will probably make sense if you stop and smell the roses a bit here and there, both in and out of the game. As a PC port of a PS4 game, there have been minimal visual glitches that I have seen that is probably a result of certain things not playing well with 120 fps and being slightly jittery in very rare spots. Oh yeah, listen to the music. This is not a request, but a demand. I have probably listened to the soundtrack for this game and others in the series for thousands of hours simply because it's such great atmospheric music","2022-11-03"

Never got around to the PS4 version and not I'm ecstatic to see this on PC. Never have I felt all these feels in all my years of gaming. The loop is pretty basic but also pretty satisfying. You will spend most of your time in dialogue and story rather than combat. Still this is one of the best titles I've ever played. Easily deserves a 10/10.","2022-12-30"
47,"Posted:","24-Oct-22","This is the 3rd time i own this game. I owned the original (steelbox), Royal (Phantom Thieves edition) and now it's time to play through it once more. As this review will gather dust, my hours played will grow into dozens, then hundreds. This is not an unbiased review. I love this series to bits, it shaped me as a person in highschool and adulthood, and I will unashamedly praise it as the best RPG and probably the game I have most loved of the thousands I've played. If that's ok with you, read on. If you've never experienced a Persona game before, I will try to make a short description, but beware; the game has so much content that not even a long form review could do it justice. Persona games are, since the 3rd entry, a coherent mix of social/high school life simulator and RPG dungeon crawler / creature collector. The first aspect is there for you to meet and deepen your bonds with a great cast of compelling, well written characters, as well as give you a suite of mini-games and activities that will net you money, items, and increase your social stats to be able to interact with said characters. Those interactions are supremely important for the dungeon aspect, as each unlocks bonuses and new mechanics for it. The dungeon running aspect consists in exploring and doing combat in a different dimension, inside both a set of hand crafted dungeons specific to a villain, as well a randomly generated, gigantic dungeon that unlocks as you go forward. In this dungeon you and your party gains increased physical abilities, as well as the capacity to summon a persona, a manifestation of the user's psyche. The protagonist is always the trickster, a special kind of personality that can create and use multiple personas at will, which is where the monster collection part comes in. So far you may think that while this does indeed sound exciting, it's not something you haven't seen before, and you'd be mostly right. Outside of the specific blend of living a normal life and being a super hero in another dimension, there's not much you haven't seen before in JRPGs, and you'd not be too wrong. However, Persona's strength isn't in doing something that no one else does but in two key aspects: Feeling and Timing. Persona 5 will make you feel at every step during the game. Its soundtrack will quickly make you at least hum along from the first few moments of hearing it, it will randomly pop up in your head as you do menial chores, you will sing along with it during car rides. It's upbeat where it has to be, it's melancholic where it has to be, and the lyrics will stay with you. The Interface is unique and stylish, with a ton of color and personality. the animations, the emotions drawn on the characters are well adapted to what's going on on the screen. You will smile as you see the Phantom Thieves jump around and kick ass, you will feel the pain that a character is struggling with, you will feel joy and empathy when they overcome their trials. Ultimately, all of these combine into a package that has both amazing aesthetics and content. The struggles of the characters are also very relatable and form a good mix of the human condition. The game will simply grab your emotions and won't let them go from start to finish. In regards to Timing, I'll say that I do expect Persona's insistence to make you live each day of the better part of a year to come off as 'padding' to some people. I see it differently. It helps sell the idea that you're actually living a life. It makes meeting and spending time with characters and growing close to them feel organic. You end up caring about them because the way you spend time ticks certain boxes inside your mind that make the illusion more real. I'd say that, taking everything into consideration, what makes Persona 5 Royal great is how it can tell an extremely larger than life story and make it feel so real and relatable. In a sense, media exists to fulfil our need to be more than who we are, to kidnap us shortly from our mundane existence and take us where we cannot go. No other game has done this to me quite like Persona 5 Royal, and I'm happy that everyone on PC and all consoles can now enjoy it. I hope you'll give it a shot too one day, and when you do, it will take your heart, as it has taken mine.","2022-10-24"

It feeds new concepts to you through the entire game through almost every hour of play from start to finish. Persona 5, is the Resident Evil 4 of the Persona Series.","2022-10-25"
54,"Posted:","6-Nov-22","Instead of making minor tweaks to an already excellent game, this RPG packs in so much content that it feels like a completely new game. Some features of Persona 5 Royal are things you'd expect to see in any ""director's cut"" game, such as more voice acting in either English or Japanese during key story moments (players have the option of choosing which they prefer at the start). Older cutscenes have been re-edited to include new characters and events, further fleshing out the game's plot. There's even an extra school semester that significantly expands the gameplay by adding new holidays, events, and exams. That would suffice in most cases, but it only scratches the surface. There are new characters to interact with (and get to help you in your adventure), as well as a new location called Kichijoji, which includes a sports bar where you can play pool and darts with your Phantom Thief friends, a jazz bar where you can hang out and invite people, and clothing stores where you can sell off gear to collect in battle. It's a place you'll want to visit again and again. Similarly, the Thieves Den feature provides you with a space full of unlockable content such as new music, character models, artwork, and more. It even includes challenges that you can complete simply by playing the main story and side missions, as well as a card game. Dungeons have also been significantly improved, thanks to a grappling hook feature that can be used to reach hidden areas or even ambush opponents from afar. Some dungeons have new layouts, including items called Will Seeds in off-the-beaten-path areas. When the entire set of these items is collected, they will restore your magic points and provide significant bonuses. Momentos, the randomised dungeons, have also been improved, with larger levels and an in-dungeon store that can provide bonus experience, money, and items while exploring these areas. And for Persona 5 veterans, restocking your ammo after each fight means you no longer have to save your ranged weapon attacks during a mission, making them far more useful. If there is a disadvantage to Royal, it is that there are so many things to do and so many options presented to you, especially once your group grows beyond four members, that it can be difficult to figure out what activity you should do when and with which characters. However, Persona 5 Royal is so large that you'll enjoy immersing yourself in it (or reintroducing yourself to its gameplay) for dozens of hours. 10/10","2022-11-06"

57,"Posted:","21-Oct-22","SDHQ STEAM DECK PERFORMANCE REVIEW: Follow our curator page for more Steam Deck reviews and our Twitter for immediate updates on all SDHQ content including reviews, news, and more! This review is based ONLY on performance of the game on the STEAM DECK. The Game Itself: Persona 5 Royal is the extended and upgraded version of the newest mainline game in the well known JRPG series. Forced to transfer to a new school in Tokyo, you and your friends band together as the Phantom Thieves to infiltrate the minds of the corrupt and make them change their ways for the better. Alongside the exciting turn-based combat, you will sneak around grand locations manifested by these wicked individuals with your crew. But when the day is done, you will be walking around the town, going to school, and improving different aspects of yourself to become as powerful as possible with your team. Persona 5 Royal on Steam includes over 40 items of previously released DLC, as well as the upgraded version of the original game with tons of added content. Persona 5 is one of my favorite JRPGs so being able to review it like this feels like a dream come true. I also had my fears of how it would run. I ran into a lot of people claiming 60 FPS at highest settings works like a charm, which makes me skeptical for a game like this. But regardless, I was happy to dive in and I am glad I did. Steam Deck Performance: So at max settings, with the rendering scale set to 100%, Persona 5 runs at 60 FPS around 70% of the time. This generally is in smaller areas and corridors, but any bigger or open areas tend to buckle under the pressure. This leads to framerate drops below 50 FPS and battery drain that can go up to 22W. Bringing rendering scale to 200% only makes it significantly worse, but we can improve it all and give the game a 4+ hour battery life with stable and smooth gameplay! By bringing shadows down to medium and setting the framerate limit to 50, I was able to set a TDP of 7 for comfortable stability and feeling incredibly smooth. This allowed me to stick below 14W, usually hanging around 10 - 11, for an incredibly long battery life. The shadow quality option didn't seem to change much either, but it definitely helped Persona 5 Royal keep a stable 50 FPS. There are some areas in the larger open ones that still slow it down, but playing at 50 instead of 60 meant these slowdowns didn't show as much. Though once I saw the 200% rendering scale option, I was curious if I could create a quality build that incorporates it. Thankfully, the game is very well optimized! With a 40 FPS cap, we can get a 95% stable framerate with a TDP of 11 to keep battery under 20W drain. And since there are chunks of the game that take place in smaller areas, the battery drain goes down and you'll probably get around 3 hours of battery! The reason I decided to have the 40 and 50 caps for each build respectively is due to the parts in the game where you are in a more open and populated area. These caps not only account for that, but also keep the battery from draining too much. Apart from that, I didn't experience any bugs or issues when playing. It was a wonderful and smooth experience! Persona 5 Royal is an incredible JRPG that tells a fantastic story with engaging gameplay and tons of content. And the cherry on top, it runs like a charm on the Steam Deck. With a low battery drain, smooth, stable gameplay, and near max settings, Persona 5 Royal is a gem on deck. If you enjoy JRPGs, story-driven experiences, or even just video games in general, check out this game!

67,"Posted:","14-Dec-22","Once more we are back with another installment of Persona series on Steam. Yes, at last, Persona fans get to experience Persona 5 (Royal) for the first time! And there's no other way around it. Persona 5 Royal is an excellent game that requires an essay-long review. If you are not into reading, I'll summarise the game shortly. Imagine a game where gameplay and story matters more than pretty graphics. Well, PERSONA 5 is that game. It is an absolute masterpiece with outstanding music, heartwarming story and likable characters. however... I do have some problems with this game, unlike I did with Persona 4 (Golden). But I'll still try as spoiler-free as possible with this review, as just like with any other Persona game, you should go into this game blind. DO NOT READ SPOILERS AND DO NOT WATCH THE ANIME ADAPTATION FIRST. However, I might mention some things on this review that you may consider a spoiler. You've been warned. Think of Persona as a game that doesn't have a definite genre. Instead it's a bunch of different sub-genres combined into one. JRPG with traditional turn-based RPG tropes, slice of life high school simulator and dating simulator in the same time. That in one package. Persona 4 was my first ever Persona game and I absolutely adore it, even today. So essentially I already knew everything I had to know about a Persona game when I started on this game. This game would be a turn-based JRPG, where our characters fight against cognitive shadows as usual. And after-school, our main character, Joker (also known as Ren Amamiya), would be hanging out with his friends and other folks to expand his bonds, in order to craft more powerful Personas in the Velvet Room. All of this is true. See, this game starts in the future. You are playing as ""silent"" protagonist, Joker/Ren, and you get to escape from a huge casino. Something goes wrong however and your playable character is caught in action and imprisoned in the real world. This is where the game jumps back to April, which is when Ren first arrived in Tokyo. He was banished from his home town to Tokyo, as he was sentenced there under probation. On his first day to school, he meets a delinquent named Ryuji Sakamoto and suddenly, his school turns into total nightmare. You soon learn that the world around you, is actually more rotten than you had ever even thought. I cannot go into greater detail about the story without in-depth spoilers. I recommend experiencing it blind. I really like how the ending (original ending) turned out, but I felt quite overwhelmed since the game ends way earlier than Persona 4. Persona 5's story is very straight-forward. While it has some major plot-twists, it's fairly easy to follow and it won't cause you a headache to figure out what is actually going on around Ren and his friends. That being said, it pales in comparison to previous installments. Ren's friends feel quite shallow and while their character designs and voice acting are quite memorable, I didn't feel emotionally resonated with any of them (okay, maybe is an exception here.). While they all have a tragic backstory of sorts, the game doesn't really do justice to any of 'em. And while the game does give all of them time to shine and get closer to Ren, outside of Ryuji, Ann, Futaba and the new addition Kasumi, none of them really feel like proper friends to me. You may disagree with me here and that's completely fine. But Persona 4's Investigation Team beats Phantom Thieves in likability in every way. Now, as per usual, main gameplay is split into two different parts. High school life in Tokyo and turn-based combat in the cognitive world. Each day, you can decide to spend time by improving your relations, study or work to improve your social stats or to enter a palace (this game's main dungeons) or Mementos. In Persona 5, palaces disappear after beating the main boss of the area, which makes farming XP, personas and usable items exceedingly difficult. To compensate for this, Persona 5 introduces Mementos, which is a place where players can easily farm XP, money and items. However, Mementos also gives you so much XP and money that you never really have to farm XP during palaces or even work after-school jobs to obtain money. Combat in this game is probably the best Persona's combat has ever felt. Persona 5 essentially took combat from Persona 4 Golden and nailed it to near perfection. You have so many options in each fight. Instead of using your melee or persona abilities, characters can now use a literal gun to eliminate shadows. After targeting shadow's weakness, characters can baton pass to other party members for increased damage and HP recovery. With this system, players can finish groups of shadows with ease by targeting weaknesses and then racking baton passes from character to character. After downing a shadow, Joker can now negotiate with them and manipulate them to join his side, meaning that obtaining new personas is probably the easiest it has ever been before. And now, by completing some specific confidant (social link) objectives, players can also swap out characters mid combat, which is essentially vital in beating some endgame bosses. All of these changes are great in making the game more enjoyable to newer players. In fact Persona 5 is easily the most accessible Persona game yet. However. It also makes Persona 5, the easiest Persona game, by far. Sure, my experience with P4G heavily impacted my playthrough, but I only failed in a boss fight once. Yes, you all probably know which boss fight I'm talking about. That's where difficulty comes in. You'd think that Persona 5 Royal's highest difficulty would be the hardest, but you'd be wrong. See. P5R's highest difficulty, Merciless, bumps up damage dealt by enemies to 3x. But simultaneously, your damage dealt to them is buffed by the same amount. Meaning, this game becomes incredibly EASY with its ""HARDEST"" DIFFICULTY if you know the enemy's weakness beforehand. I played the entire game on Hard (second highest difficulty) in purpose to make the game more difficult, with one exception, which is that before mentioned boss fight that was almost impossible to defeat with damage dealt on Hard difficulty. I went from failing the 30 minute time limit to beating the boss in 15 minutes with Merciless. However, even if the game is easier than previous installments, it still doesn't take away the sheer fun that Persona 5's combat provides. That being said, let's discuss the ROYAL EXPANSION of Persona 5. It has some interesting additions, like Kichijoji, will seeds and DLC personas. But: Royal adds a new character, , into the game. Yeah, she is great, but when it comes to story, her addition feels completely out of place, similarly to in P4G. Everytime she is on the screen, you can tell that she doesn't really fit in with the game's original narrative. And well, RoyalÕs true ending is completely different to Persona 5Õs original ending (that is still accessible and ) and retcons the gameÕs main antagonist out of the picture. However, despite my rather harsh criticism, overall, Persona 5 is still immensely fun game which has an absolute banger soundtrack. P5 has easily the best soundtrack in entire Persona series, if not one of the best video game soundtracks OF ALL TIME. I still absolutely recommend this game and itÕll be a blast to any newcomers of this series!","2022-12-14"

When I learned that Royal would be coming to PC, I was extremely excited to fall in love with this game all over again. Glad the wait was worth it. Is the game good? Yes. Absolutely. If you are a fan of JRPGs, you should've purchased this already. Great story, great characters, great music, and a graphics style brimming with personality. There are simply no other games out there quite like Persona. Is it just Persona 5 again? Yes...and no. Royal has new content including: new story events, battle mechanics, and characters. It's the same great game, but with even more to love about it. Royal also ships with most of the DLC released for the original. Is it a good PC port? Yes. This is a surprisingly great PC port for the game. It has support for up to 120 FPS for high refresh-rate monitors, a decent amount of graphical settings, and appears to have been carefully optimized for solid performance. Additionally, the game is verified for Steam Deck compatibility.","2022-10-25"

85,"Posted:","26-Nov-22","It took years of waiting and enduring owning a Playstation but wanting to play this game at high framerates, but it's finally here, and damn was it worth the wait. The Royal Edition comes with extra content, a revision of everything, new confidants, and an expansion to the finale of the game. The game is peak JRPG with a turn-based fighting system using a ""Persona"", powers similar to stands from Jojo. Strongly suggested if you're looking for a long game with a vivid world and a wonderfully written story. No matter how you want to play, it will be a long game, but it's worth the time! The Daily Life There are a lot of JRPGs out there, and while this refines most of the genre mechanics, that is not what makes it unique. In Persona, say that the story lasts for 6 months: you'll play each and every single day. Sure, you could rush through a day by spending it at home and going to sleep early, but you still have to play it. During weekdays the character will go to school, and after school and evenings are two moments you could do any activity of your choosing. From going around in the world doing errands to going out with a friend. There is no way to skip days as things like school are mandatory and automatic, we wouldn't want you to skip school now, would we? Each day has unique events attached to it for example: meeting people at the train stop, being able to take a seat on the train to read, or moments in class where you might be asked questions about a topic that if answered correctly will level up knowledge. Afternoons and evenings can be spent with confidants available on that day, activities available to the player, or simply home watching a DVD that will level up your social stats. Going out with confidants will level them up, and the more levels you have with each confidant the more abilities they offer you. Although there are bad responses to the confidants, just going out again will compensate for that. I want to put extra emphasis on the confidants, as they have a very good story that goes on during multiple get-togethers and gives them purpose and resolve. Honestly one of the best parts of the game for me. Very early in the game, it's important to learn how to treasure the free time and use it smartly, because there is a counted set of days, and after that, the game won't continue. HUD I'm one of those players whose first few hours in a game are spent constantly going to the settings page, especially to disable UI components I don't deem necessary. I enjoy games with a great UI design, and that use their space in a smart way instead of overwhelming the player leaving little of the game on screen, good UI can do a lot with little, see games like Elden Ring, Breath of the Wild and Shadow of the Colossus. As someone who pays a lot of attention to UX design, this game is just on another level. Not only it's somewhat minimal, greatly themed, and overall functional, but it's almost part of the 3D space. Even teleporting or loading is just beautiful to look at! It's used very smartly, and I would love to learn more about how they achieved results like at the end-of-fight screen where the UI goes behind the character, great use of it! It is genuinely nice to look at as it fits the game perfectly. It's not perfect, something like the clock and calendar could fade off after a bit during dungeons and some of the menus have settings a bit too deep in them not making it intuitive to find, but, overall, one of the best UIs I've ever seen! Peak JRPG While this title game is the best I've seen from JRPGs, I don't want to give the idea this game is perfect. I entered having a general idea of what to expect from the game but not knowing what I was getting into 100%. Thing is, this game improves on a lot of factors of the genre, but it also clutches to some kinks the genre always had. Know if you're going to play this game you have to be in for a lot of reading. Many hours of gameplay, outside of dungeons, could be played in minutes by skipping dialogues, and, most of the text is not dubbed, which is understandable considering the volume of it. On top of this, most of the actual gameplay happens inside ""dungeons"". While they are extremely well done, interesting to play through, better than they ever have been in Persona, and improved in Royal, on a gameplay level they are quite flat. The exploration is down to the bone mostly done with interactions, and it's perfectly fine, especially when the game excels in other parts of the explorations like puzzles. I would have enjoyed being able to jump on command instead of looking for where the interaction is with the special vision filter. I found myself looking around with the vision more than I would like because a ledge that would be normally reachable since it's not meant to be climbed on it's impossible to do. Most of the fighting can be summed up as looking for the weakness of the enemy and using it against them, be it a specific element or a combination of a status plus element. The game is not afraid of performing damage checks and using numbers in the most frustrating way to create a challenge, especially in two moments of the story. There are good challenges that actually require you to plan your attacks accordingly, and then there is just plain frustration. I mention this as one of the main bosses acts almost as a wall for players, and I think while the idea for the fight was good, the execution was just plain bad. I got there extremely prepared, I can't imagine what a nightmare it would be not being ready for this fight the games does nothing to prepare you for. A Royal Update A bit like Nier Replicant 1.2_, in Royal, Atlus has revised everything. Dungeons have a different layout, there are more confidants, more days, a different ending, and the more the merrier. It also offers more days to get things done and an extensive different finale, but it requires two confidants to be maxed out, which means speeding through the game is going to take a lot away from the experience, finale included. From PS3 to PC The game runs relatively smoothly, but don't trust the minimum requirements. Thing is, the game runs on an engine that was meant for PS3, which is why every area is separated by a loading screen, although smartly integrated. The game suffers on an engine level, no matter the hardware. Many NPC on the screen will kill performances, although it might be using 20% of the hardware. There are mods that allow the removal of background NPCs, for example, but in general, consider having better hardware than the suggested one or modding. On my hardware, the game ran mostly at 120fps, but there were moments where simply approaching a part of a city where the camera goes further away and more is loaded in that would drop it down to 60 sometimes while my hardware was not struggling at all. I assume it's probably a draw call problem as I've seen the same on Skyrim, which is also a game with the backbone of a PS3-era title, and at the time there was less room for draw calls. Talking of the game being PS3 era, some of the textures are so too. And it's sad to see Atlus not even passing them through some AI upscale to get a bit more resolution in them, especially when some things are used extensively throughout the dungeon. The AA is the worst I've seen in a long time. It's not aliasing anything. Everything in the game is extra jaggy and the only solution I found is increasing the internal resolution to almost 200%. That way you're generating so many pixels the AA has more to work with and looks better, but that kills the performance, so there's a tradeoff in both cases. Conclusion Overall the game is worth the money and time and it's a great experience if you like the genre, but while it improves on it I think a bit more could have been done to make it even more outstanding. Strongly suggested. 8.9/10","2022-11-26"

90,"Posted:","21-Oct-22","Ever since I first played the original Persona 5 on my PS4 back in 2019, it has been one of my favorite JRPGs right alongside classics like Chrono Trigger and FF7. I consider it to be one of the finest games of this genre ever made. From the incredible music and presentation to the captivating story and characters, nearly every aspect of the game is flawless. Persona 5 Royal adds extra content and polishing over the base game and makes the whole deal sweeter by also including all DLCs released. It's almost a miracle to experience it on PC now away from the shackles of a single platform. On a more technical side, the PC port is excellent. Runs at a flawless 120fps at 4K and the KB+M controls are well thought out. Not much more I could ask from Atlus really. If you're a JRPG fan, you'll absolutely love Persona 5. If you're not, this just might be the game to convert you.","2022-10-21"

92,"Posted:","21-Dec-22","Like my reviews? Go follow my Curator page. It's showtime Despite the longstanding history of Atlus's Shin Megami Tensei series, the games didn't seem to find success with mainstream audiences until the Persona spinoff games released. 5, in particular, had so much widespread hype that it is a common joke about fans of Persona 5 is that they haven't even played it. This hype also applied to critics, who have called this Persona 5 one of the best RPGs ever, with the Royal version only solidifying that claim. Is it one of the best RPGs of all time? I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I would certainly call it one of the better RPGs of the last decade. Graphics What Persona 5 Royal lacks in technical prowess, it makes up for by being one of the best-looking games ever purely from a stylistic perspective. The UI absolutely oozes charm, and is remarkably easy to follow. This loud and flashy presentation absolutely could've made it difficult to follow along with the game in general, but there's so much detail and depth that I found it quite easy to tell where I was in the midst of menus. Another big area where this game excels is in its character designs. The equally flashy outfits your Metaverse-hopping party wears are also representative of their character arcs in subtle ways. For example, the character with the hardest exterior has spikes on her pauldrons, or the intelligent, watchful character wears the mask of a crow. All of these little details really add up, and it's easy for the confidence of the presentation to start rubbing off on the player. This game is not the benchmark for visual presentation, because it goes so far beyond the benchmark that no other game could really compete. Gameplay The biggest improvement P5R has over its predecessor is in its gameplay. Gone are the days of randomly-generated dungeons (for the most part), and combat has been both sped up and expanded upon in ways that ensure that you never get bored. At the same time, the core gameplay loop remains intact. The game is split into two parts: a dungeon crawling, monster-collecting JRPG and what is essentially a visual novel. It juggles the balance between those two areas quite nicely, and new mechanics are given out at pretty reasonable rates. The dungeons are significantly more enjoyable to go through compared to 4, however I wouldn't call them great by any means. I think 4's dungeons were one of the game's biggest issues because they felt like slogs to get through, so the bar wasn't high to begin with. The dungeons are victim to a more egregious issue with this game that I will expand upon in the story section, but otherwise they're passable for the most part. The quality of life improvements, plus the new attack types are all very welcome additions that expand upon the weakness-exploiting core of combat. Of course, there's been some streamlining done on the less action-packed side of the game. It's very easy to identify who is available to hang out with each day, and I'm a big fan of the function that tells you what other people did that day. You'll also have plenty of time to max out your confidants, and the game does a great job of pointing out the confidant deadlines for characters that are especially relevant to the plot and may influence your ending. Story I do love this game, but this is unfortunately the game's weak point, which is a major issue for what is supposed to be a very story-driven game. The main distinction with the Persona series compared to the SMT series is the former's emphasis on characters as opposed to the latter's emphasis on themes. I would consider Persona 4 to have one of the best RPG casts ever, and unfortunately 5 does not quite live up to that for me. The characters aren't bad by any means - their arcs are believable and fun to watch for the most part (barring Morgana, who is only slightly less insufferable than 4's Teddie). However, something I noticed is that main characters are very quickly sidelined to introduce new ideas, and some of them very much dominate scenes over others. The antagonists aren't much better. The manner in which the main characters, the Phantom Thieves, attempt to change society has a lot of interesting ethical implications that don't really get expanded upon (besides in the Royal content) because the game chooses to make most of the antagonists irredeemably, almost comically evil. I don't mind when completely evil antagonists, but this game really wants you to hate almost all of them and only managed to succeed with the first one. And how does this game try to get the player to hate these baddies? With Royal's biggest issue: the incredibly repetitive dialogue! You will sit through several minutes of conversations where characters repeat things that were already established several hours ago, or try to make a ""grand"" reveal about things that were blatantly obvious. This game's insane length is primarily due to this issue. Dungeons are bogged down by characters saying things like ""What is that on the wall? Is that a slot for a keycard? I think it is! That must mean there's a keycard nearby. Where do you think the keycard is? Oh, maybe it's that glowing thing over there making a sound effect! Joker, let's go get that keycard!"" Most of the villains will tell you how evil they are, but I can't bring myself to care about anything they're saying because it's very obvious and there's nothing to show for it. This issue is especially noticeable because of the antagonists that don't fit that bill are some of the most interesting characters in the game. I did like most of the main story, I just wasn't a fan of how a lot of characters were handled or the equally terrible and repetitive writing that plagues most of the game. The Royal content absolutely saves this game (the antagonist especially), but also really highlights how much better this story could've been. Audio Thankfully, while the writing isn't great, the voice acting definitely is. The characters are really brought to life by their performances. Akechi, Maruki, Ryuji, and Ann are all major highlights here. The soundtrack is also incredible, and there are a few tracks that I've added to my Spotify playlists, which is a feat in itself because I usually hate adding video game music to my playlists. I wish I had more to say here, but this was always an area this series excelled in and this game is no different. Content Value Persona 5 is too long. The bloat lies in the insanely repetitive dialogue, and I think skipping through some of the pointless stuff is the sole reason I finished this in under 100 hours. That said, if that bloat was cut, there would still be more than enough content to warrant a $60 purchase. Again, this is a series norm so of course it's worth full price, I just think it went a little overboard this time. Verdict Ultimately, I think Persona 5 Royal is a stellar game with some stratospheric highs and some disappointing lows. I did end up loving my time with the game, but I wanted to emphasize my criticisms for this review as opposed to parroting the praises of the game's incredible strengths. It's bloated, messily-written, and wastes the potential of multiple characters, but it still stole my heart, and will likely steal yours too. Graphics - 5/5 Gameplay - 4/5 Story - 3/5 Audio - 5/5 Content Value - 4/5 .:9.0/10:. ""Amazing"" + Incredible visual presentation + Great character designs & performances + Amazing soundtrack + Fun & addictive gameplay loop + Lots of QoL improvements - Repetitive & poor writing bloats the game length - Mishandles multiple characters","2022-12-21"
