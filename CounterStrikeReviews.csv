After 8 years playing it, I didn't improve my skills in-game.

However, I learned new language skills: now I can curse in Russian and Brazilian Portuguese.

Also, my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased.

Now I can bear the crying of my children for longer and I can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures, such as Очи чёрные (Dark Eyes) or Garota de Ipanema (The Girl from Ipanema).

In conclusion, Counter Strike transformed me into a better father and a better person, in addition to making me more patient, tolerant to hateful people and more trained in languages and cultures.

Better than any psychiatric therapy. 10/10"

The time I spent playing this game could've been spent...
...studying
...applying for jobs
...making friends irl
...getting a wife
...spending time with my family
...working out
...becoming a better man in general

From the time I spent in this game, I got...
...an extremely racist and homophobic vocabulary
...free Russian lessons
...anger management issues
...borderline autistic tendencies
...sleep deprivation

10/10 would never uninstall this game and correct my life

P.S. PLEASE for the love of all that is holy, practice in Deathmatch and Casual as well as perfect your cross-hair and mouse sensitivity before you jump into competitive. People will thank you for it."

After 100 hours I knew the basics of the game and the guns available
After 200 hours I threw away the knowledge of all guns and sprayed the P90
After 300 hours I clicked on people's heads with an SG
After 400 hours I was bad and abandoned ranked
After 500 hours I played wingman on Lake
After 600 hours I partook in an additional mild quantity of the winged male upon the realm by the Lake
After 700 hours I was silver 1 in wingman
After 800 hours I started playing on 130 ping to contain my sheer ability and flawless aim to give the rest of the community a chance
After 900 hours I have become a master of the arts in using a nova on 130 ping and the world trembles as I kill countless awptists with a swift burst of hot metal straight to the temple
Maybe once I hit 1000 hours I'll finally get out of silver

Now I got out of silver and I'm running straight back, hopefully I'll get back there by 1500"

Fun game overall, though it may at times consume too much of your day time.
You will come across many toxic-salty people, just ignore-report-mute them.
You will have days that you may play like a pro and feel good and your dopamine will skyrocket, but you will be accused of cheating by your ""victims"".
you will have days that you can't even get a shot and you will be told to possibly cease to exist and delete this game possibly something about your close relatives but as I said in my second point, ignore-mute-report whatever you dont like.

Enjoy this game, be less toxic, obviously don't cheat what would be the point.

So what do we need to do to get good in this game?

Step 1:
Accept you aren't the best and make mistakes like everyone else

Step 2:
Setup your Gear. Have a good Microphon and use it.

Step 3:
Warmup before Competitive Games. Doesn't matter if you kill 1000 Bots on an Aim-Map or play Deathmatch for about 20 Minutes.

Step 4:
Practice all necessary skills for the Game
- AIM -> Deathmatch; Aim-Maps; Practice-Maps (Recoilmaster etc.)
- Movement -> Climb-servers; Surfing, Prefire-Maps (Shortcuts from Yesber too)
- Gamesense -> Matchmaking; Retake-Servers
- Mapknowledge -> Callouts; Demos from your favourite Pro-Player,
- Nades -> pls learn them
- Roles -> Entry; Support; Lurk; AWPer

Additional Steps:
- Train your Habit (first callout then flame)
- play daily to to improve your aim
- make pauses every 2-3 games to reset (go outside from the room with your Pc)
- stop at the point you get mad (after a loss may)


If you follow all these Steps you will be able to climb the ladder and improve fast.

Have a nice day and start fraggin!

P.S.: Last Step: Get friends to play with and play for the win not for stats!!!"

I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5.
It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.

Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.

We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland.
However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.

I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.

After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.

CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).

Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.

Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.

If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.

However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.

I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.

Best Regards
Knight"

The competitive Counter-Strike scene is at its peak. There’s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world you need clear, specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events—no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list. I also decided to use roughly the past six months’ results for statistical comparison, with obviously more emphasis on recent performances, as they are most likely more indicative of these players’ current form."

What can you say about Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? It's everything you could ever want from a first-person shooter. You can play it like a no-life gremlin, but you can also boot it up and just frick around with the lads and dads without worrying too much about strategic play. It's also a very fun eSport to watch if you're into that sort of thing. My CS:GO phase is done but I will always have fond memories of rushing B sneeki beeki like. EZPZ lemon squeezy"

I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.

I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product

Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).

Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.

It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).

Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).

Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.

If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.

In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very."

2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol

Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.

To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:

* It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on

* Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player

* Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google

* have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100

* No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it

* As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve

* If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves

* SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me

Hi valve just wondering now that csgo is free to play is it possible that you could reward those that have originally purchased the game.😀😁😁😁😁😀😀😀😀😀😀

for those idiots who cant read im not asking for no refund im simply saying maybe they should give us a free key or a nice skin as a reward

sorry comments are now disabled since all the toxic ♥♥♥♥♥ in the comments and was getting bored of deleting comments"

The game where you think you're better than anyone else because you devoted 22 years of your life to ""mastering"" it, only to continue getting eco 1deaged from across the map on a awp full util buy by a kid that just launched the game for the first time 3 hours ago."

I purchased this game on release day and played it for about three hours. It was absolute crap and I uninstalled it.

Fast forward just about one year and my friend recommended I try it again. Well, i've got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from it's release version.

The game is basically 1.6 with improved graphics and mechanics. While it still needs work in many areas, the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $14.99.

If you're a long time CS player like me (Beta 1) and don't have this game yet, add me to your friends list and we'll reminisce about the old days and maybe i'll throw a copy your way.

Coming back to edit the review many years later, CSGO has gone free to play and has improved a lot over the years. Glad to see the game is still kicking strong."

Do you like to argue with random people on your team? Do you want to learn how to speak simple yet essential Russian phrases? Do you like to dress up your guns with flashy yet useless skins? Of course you do, so hurry up get this game and either drop it after a week or play for an eternity."

CS:GO Is a very competetive, and fun game when you're not playing against hackers, but while playing with friends you have a great time no matter what, I highly recommend this game for competetive games and even the community servers, such as surf, and b-hop maps."

This Russian Language learning game is quite impressive, already after a few games I had a rather vast comprehension of the language and Its underlying culture.

A few russian fellas said my grasp was ""fluent"".

Protip: DA DA, DAVAI DAVAI RUSH B CYKA BLYAT!
One of the most frequent phrases used by Russian CS:GO Pros, translated; Rush B. Don't stop - until a molotov comes and then all should stop in the tunnel for a pleasant barbeque experience."

Good Fried Chicken Recipe:

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce (optional, for added flavor), salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Add in chicken pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours.
When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees.
Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly.
Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess.
Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.
Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving."

I've been playing Counter-Strike since around 2000 when it was 1.6 beta. It was a natural progression for me from HL Deathmatch which was a ton of fun back in the day also. I've been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours I wouldn't even want to know playing it, but i've had a ton of fun with it too!!

It's funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows, especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that, without CS I question if there would even be a Steam service. It's funny how things happen!!

Nobody will ever read this so i have no idea why i'm spending the time writing a review of this type, especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more XP, funny :)

CS and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and i'm forever grateful for that, but I have to say that the current state of affairs with the game, steam and Valve are a little sad. There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me. Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from. The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!). Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy? If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for??? Think about it and get back to me why don't you (and i'll be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants - sarcasm).

My review won't be complete without touching on the current Steam vs Opskins, and the whole trading saga in general. Why won't Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.? There's so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service? It's a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you're just dealing with so much legal backlog from the ""loot box"" gambling situation?!?!?! Who know's? Certainly nobody in the community, why? No communication. Is it because you don't think you're client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don't consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to? A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo.

Anyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority.

Cheers
Chris

Playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is like playing a game of chess, except instead of pawns and bishops, you have AK-47s and grenades. And instead of a calm, calculated opponent, you have a bunch of 13-year-old kids screaming into their mics. But despite all that, this game can be a lot of fun. There's nothing quite like the thrill of defusing a bomb with 0.001 seconds left on the clock, or the satisfaction of getting a headshot on someone who's been trash-talking you all game. And let's not forget the joy of accidentally shooting your own teammate in the back and getting kicked from the game. All in all, if you're looking for a game that will make you question your own sanity, while also providing hours of entertainment, then Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the game for you. Just make sure to stock up on Advil and earplugs before you start playing."

After some hours of CS GO I have discovered that learning Russian and Turkish or such languages can be done within no time in this game (also a lot cheaper than paying for classes)
Can recommend this Language Simulator even though it can be quite explicit at times ^^
(Do NOT worry about hackers in this game, there are less hackers than players who should not be allowed to use a microphone!)

Would definitely learn a new language again."
